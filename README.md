# CycleGAN
Using CycleGAN to convert Monet paintings to Photos and vice versa

Based on the code by Jason Brownlee from his blogs on https://machinelearningmastery.com/
I am adapting his code to various applications but original credit goes to Jason. 

**Orginal CycleGAN implementation:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.10593.pdf
